## Intro

You can pass custom data into the widget so that when it loads on the page, the AI will know more details about your visitor.

Examples of information you can include:
- your customer's email, name, ID
- their most recent order information

This information can be made available inside the dashboard, on the Inbox page, for your agents.

Additionally, it can be given as instructions to the AI. Molin will remember your information in the conversation with the customer.

## Injecting directly into the component

If you manually render the custom components `<molin-shop-ai>` or `<molin-shop-ai-chat>`, you can pass in the data as an attribute:

```html
<molin-shop-ai-chat x-user-data="{...}"></molin-shop-ai-chat>
```

## Automatic injection

Simply include your data in a `<script>`:

```html
<script>
  window.molinSettings = {
    ...
  };
</script>
```

## User data format

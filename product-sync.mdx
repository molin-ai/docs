title: 'Product Sync API'
description: 'Let Molin learn your products quickly'
---

This spec describes a JSON API served via HTTP, using header-based authentication and the schema.org format for product data.

## Intro

We borrowed the [JSON-LD spec](https://json-ld.org/) because shops already use it, for example visit any product page hosted by Shopify and you’ll find a `type="application/ld+json"` script tag encoding product information in a [schema.org](https://schema.org) format.

## Endpoints

We require the following endpoints if you are creating a custom API for us.

### Retrieving all products

We need an endpoint that we can call frequently to download your products.

#### Spec

- Content-Type must be **application/json**
- The body must contain a list of products encoded as a JSON string
- Each product object must be of type [Product (schema.org)](https://schema.org/Product)

#### Example

GET [https://petshop.com/molin/products.json](https://petshop.com/molin/products.json)

```json
[
  {
    "@context": "http://schema.org",
    "@type": "Product",
    "name": "Coffee Lenoa | Espresso",
    "brand": "Coffee Lenoa",
    "image": "//lenoacoffeeandshop.hu/cdn/shop/files/...",
    "url": "https://lenoacoffeeandshop.hu/products/lenoa-espresso",
    "offers": {
      "@type": "AggregateOffer",
      "priceCurrency": "USD",
      "lowPrice": "12.99",
      "highPrice": "19.99",
      "itemCondition": "http://schema.org/New",
      "availability": "http://schema.org/InStock",
      "offerCount": "2",
      "offers": [
        {
          "@type": "Offer",
          "name": "Coffee Lenoa | Espresso — 1000 gramm",
          "availability": "http://schema.org/InStock",
          "priceCurrency": "USD",
          "price": "19.99"
        },
        {
          "@type": "Offer",
          "name": "Coffee Lenoa | Espresso — 250 gramm",
          "availability": "http://schema.org/InStock",
          "priceCurrency": "USD",
          "price": "12.99"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

The above response contains 1 product along with price and stock information.

Note: You don’t have to use an AggregateOffer, you can just return 1 offer (1 price).

#### Mandatory fields

- **name**
- **offers** (so we can extract a price — must include **price** and **priceCurrency**)
- **url** (so we can uniquely identify the product)

#### Optional but recommended fields

- **Image**

### Retrieving 1 product

This is an optimization that we have not built yet.

If you have lots of products, it is more efficient to also offer a single product endpoint. For example, if a customer asks Molin about the stock of 1 specific product, we will update only this specific product (quicker than downloading all of them).

## Authentication

You may add header-based authentication that relies on a simple shared secret (token).

### Example

If you give us the token `M123ABC`, we will include the following header in all requests:

```
Authorization: M123ABC
```
